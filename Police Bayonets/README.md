After reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0">this NYTimes article</a> I became interested in how the Pentagon funded local police departments. I chose the most ridiclious thing I could think of my loca police department having a surplus of: bayonets.

I found the source, <a href="https://github.com/TheUpshot/Military-Surplus-Gear">this GitHub repository</a> and began to investigate more.

Using specific item names and stock numbers I sorted out everything that wasn't classified as a bayonet, you can check that on the sources sheet. I totaled the quantities, price, and county. This was fairly easy, much easier than the data on OSHA deaths atleast.

Then I summed up all the data for each state and graphed it using both Google Sheets and <a href="http://openheatmap.com">openheatmap.com</a>. Personally I think these results are insane, but you can make your decision.
