For this project I wanted to see how populations & specifically race have grown over time in my community, state, and country. 

I used the <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html">US Decennial Census</a> publication archive to manually record the population numbers from 1960-2010 for Downers Grove, Lisle, Woodrdige, Du Page County, Illinois, and the United States. I did this for the raw population, african american, and hispanic as available.

First I used Google Sheets' graphing to simply graph the data, it's really interesting actually.

<h3>Then, as you can see on <a href="http://afitz.space">my website</a> I use ChartJS to graph it a little prettier.</h3>
